# BIO_350 
starting our BIO350 assignments repo
IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
- making a difference equation 

IC_Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook
- making an exponential equation 
- introduced matplotib, and plotting x and y-axis

IC_assignment 2
installed pandas
downloaded population_data.csv from canvas and imported it into VSCode
used co-pilot to help plot a graph and make changes according to what we wanted (added green line representing the average population, and made the graph black with dots as data points)
heard about Elon Merger


IC_assignment 4
- made an algorithm to calculate 2 seperate species to visualise interspecific competition
- found out what competitive exclusion means, and what alpha means
- used co-pilot to help find out when the populations reached 0 (if ever)
- did most of the code on my own - yay

IC exercise 3: how to calculate and solve for the ability to coexist
- plotted different variables on Lotka-Volterrato graph try and see when the two plant species can coexist (used same code/data as previous class) 
- introduced beta which is the effect that population X has on Y, whereas alpha is the effect that Y has on X

IC Assignment (age-structured models - Chapter 12)
- used matrix multiplication 
- created an algorithm that calculates the beetle populations over 150 years
- cretated two graphs, one showing the population growth without traps, and one showing the population growth with traps present. There was a significant decline in beetle populations when traps were present.

IC Assignment (21 October)
- Built an age-structured Leslie matrix model for a real-world example: loggerhead sea turtles, using 5 age classes with specified survival rates and fecundity.
-Simulated population dynamics over 50 years, tracking both the absolute population and the percentage distribution across age classes.
- Analyzed model behavior, identifying a transient phase (years 0–20) where age structure shifts, followed by a stable phase (years 20–50) with constant proportions across age classes.
- Plotted normalized and percentage-based graphs, including a percentage graph with a y-axis break to better visualize small and large age class contributions.
- Discussed the differences between normalized and percentage plots, and wrote clear explanations and summaries of model outcomes and graph interpretations.

IC Assignment (23 October)
- Did an assignment based on Chapter 13 and Chapter 14 of the Handbook of Quantitative Ecology
- Built and simulated age- and species-structured population models for trees using Leslie-like transition matrices and survival/fecundity parameters.
- Explored transition matrices and population dynamics for different tree species (Beech, Maple, Other), including species-specific survival and reproduction rates.
- Simulated population dynamics of a two-species model with four states (including extinct and population states) using a given transition matrix over 50 years, while capping total population size at 100.
- Visualized the population trend over time specifically for the first state (z_z or extinct) using a line plot.
