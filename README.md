# BIO_350 
starting our BIO350 assignments repo
IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
- making a difference equation 

IC_Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook
- making an exponential equation 
- introduced matplotib, and plotting x and y-axis

IC_assignment 2
installed pandas
downloaded population_data.csv from canvas and imported it into VSCode
used co-pilot to help plot a graph and make changes according to what we wanted (added green line representing the average population, and made the graph black with dots as data points)
heard about Elon Merger


IC_assignment 4
- made an algorithm to calculate 2 seperate species to visualise interspecific competition
- found out what competitive exclusion means, and what alpha means
- used co-pilot to help find out when the populations reached 0 (if ever)
- did most of the code on my own - yay

IC exercise 3: how to calculate and solve for the ability to coexist
- plotted different variables on Lotka-Volterrato graph try and see when the two plant species can coexist (used same code/data as previous class) 
- introduced beta which is the effect that population X has on Y, whereas alpha is the effect that Y has on X
-
